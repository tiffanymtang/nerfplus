# Network-assisted Random Forest+ (NeRF+)

[Network-assisted Random Forest+]() (NeRF+) is a flexible and interpretable machine learning model for incorporating network data alongside node-level covariate information. Briefly, NeRF+ extends a generalization of random forests (RF) called RF+ [(Agarwal et al. 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01932) to the network-assisted regression setting by incorporating both a network cohesion penalty and network embeddings as additional covariates. Using this approach, NeRF+ inherits both the flexibility and interpretability of RFs while allowing researchers to easily incorporate network information in their model to further improve predictive performance.

For more details, check out [Tang, T. M., Levina, E., Zhu, J. "Interpretable Network-assisted Random Forest+." (2025).]()

## Project Structure

This directory contains all of the code necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures in [Tang et al. (2025)]().

Moreover, to facilitate reproducibility of this work, we leveraged [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to create a reproducible environment and [`simChef`](https://yu-group.github.io/simChef/) to create a reproducible and transparent simulation workflow. Thus, to install the necessary dependencies and reproduce the simulation, the following steps are recommended:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `nerfplus-manuscript.Rproj` in RStudio.
3. Run the following code in the R console:

```r
# install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

4. See `job_scripts/driver.sh` to run each of the simulation driver scripts, located in the `meals/` directory.
5. Render all of the figures/results by running the `scripts/figures.R` script.
